## How the Program Works

The program fetches data from [TheMealDB API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php) to get a list of food categories. Users can click on the "CHECK" button to view the available food items under a selected category. The app dynamically generates cards for each category and food item, displaying relevant information and images. Users can also submit comments through the input form.
